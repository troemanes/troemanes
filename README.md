### 📂 Why My Repositories Are Private  

As an aspiring entrepreneur, the majority of my projects are **non-open-source** because:  
- They are published or will be published on the **Google Play Store** as part of my startup initiatives.  
- I aim to protect the **intellectual property** and unique value propositions of these applications.  

Feel free to check out the **live apps** linked below to explore my work in action.

### 💼 Current Projects  

1. **Event-U-Ally**: A social media platform designed for creating and joining events. This was my first major application and the project that inspired me to start learning coding, marking the beginning of my startup journey. Although it was published on the Play Store, it was later removed due to some issues. I am currently redesigning the UI and planning to republish it on Play Store while actively seeking investment opportunities.

2. **DungeonWarrior**: A cross-platform RPG game with immersive gameplay, developed using **Jetpack Compose**. It is almost ready to publish on Play Store.  

3. **Staring Contest**: A social game leveraging **Google's ML Kit** for real-time face tracking. (Still under development)
