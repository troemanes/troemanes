### 📂 Why My Repositories Are Private

### 💼 Current Projects  

1. **Event-U-Ally**: A social media platform designed for creating and joining events. This was my first major application and the project that inspired me to start learning coding, marking the beginning of my startup journey. Although it was published on the Play Store, it was later removed due to some issues. I am currently redesigning the UI and planning to republish it on Play Store while actively seeking investment opportunities.

2. **DungeonWarrior**: A cross-platform RPG game with immersive gameplay, developed using **Jetpack Compose**. It is almost ready to publish on Play Store.  

3. **Staring Contest**: A social game leveraging **Google's ML Kit** for real-time face tracking. (Still under development)

### 🤔 Why Do I Have Fewer Projects?  

My goal is to become an entrepreneur, and my journey began with creating my own social media application from scratch. This ambitious undertaking required me to not only learn coding but also tackle the complexities of building a product with real-world impact.  

I prioritize **quality over quantity**, focusing on creating unique, high-quality applications with original designs and innovative ideas. Instead of producing simple, template-based apps to fill my portfolio, I aim to bring my dreams to life by building meaningful projects that reflect my creativity and vision.  

For me, the value of a portfolio lies in showcasing impactful and purposeful projects rather than an abundance of basic or generic ones. Each project I undertake is a step towards achieving my long-term goals, and I invest my full effort to ensure it stands out.
